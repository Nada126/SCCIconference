# SCCIconference
PHP project for SCCI participants
SCCI is a student activity.
Acadimic members in SCCI make a competition between participants who divided into groups so we as the IT members made this website to help acadimic members keep track of the groups throughout the week of the competition to know finally who is the winning group from their feedback about each group.
